## Reviewer comment -> GitHub issue map (unaddressed items)

Date: 2026-02-17  
Repository: `diodz/dpl-earthquakes`

This tracker records journal-review comments that still required action and maps each to an open GitHub issue.  
Each created issue includes explicit robustness requirements for both:
- Chile (Maule), and
- New Zealand (Canterbury).

| 3.2 Uniform confidence sets (beyond in-time placebos) | Addressed (uniform sets, timing sensitivity, rolling in-time placebo; table and figures in manuscript) | [#32](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/32) |

| 3.6 Circularity and crowding-out in sectoral interpretation | Addressed (parallel Chile/NZ sectoral SCM figures, corrected construction-share magnitude, placebo inference, and crowding-out quantification in shares and levels) | [#35](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/35) |
| 3.7 Insurance-liquidity channel needs direct testing | Unaddressed | [#36](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/36) |

## Reviewer #2

| Reviewer comment | Status | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| Major 1: SUTVA/inter-regional spillovers (O'Higgins/Auckland contamination risk) | Addressed (spillover diagnostics + progressive geographic exclusions) | [#33](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/33) |
| Major 2: Mechanism identification remains conjectural | Partial | [#30](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/30), [#34](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/34), [#36](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/36) |
| Major 3: Event comparability differences (magnitude, multi-shock, urban/rural) | Addressed (cross-case comparability framing + spatial controls + symmetric timing checks) | [#29](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/29) |
| Major 4: Sectoral presentation/inference gaps (missing Maule figures, precision claim) | Addressed (Maule sectoral figures added, precision claim corrected, and sectoral placebo inference reported) | [#35](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/35) |
| Major 5: Alternative confounders (commodity prices, FX, cycle, Region I check) | Addressed (added explicit confounder robustness framing + Region I exclusion clarification) | [#38](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/38) |

| Minor 2: Canterbury treatment timing sensitivity (2010 vs 2011) | Addressed (full timing sensitivity: NZ 2010/2011/2012, Chile 2009/2010/2011; table and figures in manuscript) | [#40](https://github.com/diodz/dpl-earthquakes/issues/40) |
