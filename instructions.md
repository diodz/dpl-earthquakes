Your objective is to improve the article at main.tex so that it is accepted for publication at a rigorous academic journal. The reviewers sent comments on a previous version of the manuscript, which are available at raw_reviewer_comments.md. Look at the reviewer comments if additional context is necesary for completing your current objective. Note that main.tex is to become the article that will be submitted to the journal, so it must not address the reviewers directly. Only the file response_to_reviewers.tex may address the reviewers directly. Your analysis must be rigurous and consistent, and every time you make a change, you must be certain that the article remains coherent and consistent.
