\subsection*{Reviewer \#1}

\paragraph{Comment 3.1 (GDP per-capita decomposition request).}
We implemented the requested decomposition by extending the Canterbury SCM to estimate three outcomes under the \emph{same} donor pool and pre-treatment setup: (i) GDP per capita, (ii) total regional GDP (level), and (iii) total population.

We added two new figures and accompanying text to the manuscript (Section~4, Results). Figure~\ref{fig:nz_decomposition_paths} shows the treated vs.\ synthetic paths for total GDP and population; Figure~\ref{fig:nz_decomposition_gaps} displays the corresponding gaps in percentage terms. The revised text reports: by 2016, the GDP-per-capita gap is 12.7\%, the total-GDP gap is 5.9\%, and the population gap is $-3.6$\%. Averaging over 2011--2022, the gaps are 6.8\% (GDP per capita), 5.0\% (total GDP), and $-3.6$\% (population).

\paragraph{Interpretation}
Yes, Canterbury's per-capita gap survives the decomposition. The positive post-quake GDP-per-capita divergence is not driven by denominator mechanics alone: total GDP itself rises above synthetic, while population remains below synthetic. Hence, the per-capita effect reflects the combined contribution of a stronger numerator and a smaller denominator relative to the counterfactual.

\paragraph{Comment 3.2 (placebo and timing inference).}
\textit{``Please provide stronger evidence that the Canterbury result is not driven by arbitrary treatment timing, and document the corresponding placebo diagnostics.''}

\paragraph{Response.}
Thank you for this suggestion. We expanded the timing analysis to provide full treatment-year sensitivity outputs (not only textual claims). Specifically, we now estimate:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{New~Zealand:} 2010-start, 2011-start (preferred), and 2012 sequence-aware start.
  \item \textbf{Chile:} 2010 baseline plus nearby placebo starts (2009 and 2011) for symmetry.
\end{itemize}

For each timing choice, we report pre/post fit quality, post/pre RMSPE ratio, and placebo ranking in a dedicated table and figure set (Table~\ref{tab:timing_sensitivity}, Figures~\ref{fig:timing_sensitivity_paths}--\ref{fig:timing_sensitivity_rmspe}). We also export machine-readable outputs (\texttt{article\_assets/timing\_sensitivity\_summary.csv}, \texttt{timing\_sensitivity\_gaps.csv}, \texttt{timing\_sensitivity\_placebo\_distribution.csv}).

Conclusion-wise, Canterbury remains strongly positive across timing conventions, while Maule remains non-positive under nearby placebo starts; therefore, the main cross-case conclusion does not depend on the treatment-year definition.

\paragraph{Comment 3.3 (SDID and bias-corrected SCM robustness).}
\textit{``Given the long post-treatment window, please implement SDID and a bias-corrected/penalized SCM (especially for Maule) to test robustness to inexact matching.''}

\paragraph{Response.}
Implemented. We added a new robustness module (\texttt{src/sdid\_bias\_corrected\_analysis.py}) that estimates:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item SDID for both Canterbury and Maule, and
  \item penalized (bias-corrected) SCM following the Abadie--L'Hour framework (reported for both countries; requested case Maule included).
\end{enumerate}

The revised manuscript reports these estimates in a new robustness table and figure (Table~\ref{tab:sdid_penalized}, Figure~\ref{fig:sdid_penalized_gaps}). Numerically:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Canterbury}: baseline SCM average post-gap (2011--2019) is \(+7.8\%\); SDID is \(+7.8\%\); penalized SCM is \(+6.5\%\).
  \item \textbf{Maule}: baseline SCM average post-gap (2010--2019) is \(-1.7\%\); SDID is \(-5.1\%\); penalized SCM is \(-1.5\%\).
\end{itemize}

Hence, Canterbury's overshoot persists when optimizing both unit and time weights (SDID), while Maule remains non-positive under all alternative estimators. This directly addresses concerns about long-window robustness and edge-of-convex-hull matching for Maule.
