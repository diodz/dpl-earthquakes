# Publication Readiness Evaluation (Target Journal: *Empirical Economics*)

## Executive recommendation

**Current status: Revise and Resubmit (promising, but not yet publication-ready for *Empirical Economics*).**

The manuscript now has a substantially stronger empirical core than the earlier version (SCM inference upgrades, timing/placebo checks, spillover diagnostics, and several robustness appendices are in place). However, key publication risks remain in three areas that *Empirical Economics* referees are likely to treat as first-order: (i) mechanism identification remains largely narrative, (ii) welfare interpretation is still vulnerable to “replacement boom vs. net wealth” critique, and (iii) some reviewer-requested items are visibly incomplete in the response package.

## What is strong and close to publishable

1. **Clear comparative quasi-experimental design with two relevant case studies.**
   The paper frames Maule (Chile) and Canterbury (New Zealand) as comparable large shocks and applies SCM to both with transparent donor weights and diagnostics. This is a good fit for applied empirical standards in regional economics/disaster literature.

2. **Methodological breadth has improved materially.**
   The revised manuscript explicitly adds: placebo-gap inference, pre/post RMSPE ranking, uniform confidence sets for entire post-treatment paths, leave-one-out checks, predictor-weight sensitivity, and in-time placebos. This is a serious improvement in inferential discipline.

3. **Interpretation has become more cautious than in many SCM disaster papers.**
   The text now explicitly notes attenuation over time and positions institutions as a mediator rather than a sole causal driver in several places.

## Remaining weaknesses that still block acceptance

### A. Conceptual framing still over-claims relative to measured outcome

- The title and some language invoke “wealth,” yet the main estimand is GDP per capita (a flow), not net wealth, welfare, or productivity. This mismatch remains a high-risk editorial objection for *Empirical Economics*.
- Reviewer 1’s “broken-window” concern was correctly identified as central and is still only partially addressed in the project tracking document.

**Why this matters for publication:** leading empirical journals are increasingly strict about claims matching estimands. Even with excellent SCM execution, a flow-based rise after reconstruction can be interpreted as replacement spending unless wealth/productivity channels are separately identified.

### B. Mechanism identification remains suggestive, not causal

- The manuscript proposes insurance architecture, state capacity, and social coordination as explanatory channels, but these are not tested with a formal mechanism design (e.g., mediator outcomes with explicit identification assumptions, event-time mechanism regressions, or auxiliary micro-evidence).
- Open reviewer mapping still marks mechanism-heavy comments as unaddressed/partial (insurance as exogenous inflow, social-capital channel evidence, direct liquidity channel testing).

**Why this matters for publication:** *Empirical Economics* can publish reduced-form papers, but the current narrative repeatedly interprets cross-country differences through mechanisms that are not directly identified in the presented design.

### C. Response-to-reviewers dossier is visibly incomplete

- In the response document, several major comments have placeholder “Response.” stubs (notably on wealth-vs-flow, insurance BoP inflows, welfare caveat prominence, and Table 4 formal integration). Even if manuscript text improved, incomplete referee responses are itself a procedural risk at resubmission.

**Why this matters for publication:** editors and referees evaluate not just the revised manuscript but also whether concerns were directly and transparently answered.

### D. Cross-case comparability remains defensible but still fragile

- The paper adds timing and spatial checks, which is good, yet the two shocks still differ materially (single mega-subduction event affecting broad territory vs multi-shock urban sequence). Without stronger normalization/heterogeneity decomposition, the institutional comparison can still appear over-interpreted.

**Why this matters for publication:** comparative case logic is acceptable, but claims should be calibrated to “suggestive comparative evidence” rather than “institutional explanation established.”

### E. Welfare caveat not yet centered enough for external readers

- The manuscript includes caveats, but the risk remains that readers interpret positive post-disaster GDP gaps as social “benefits” of earthquakes.

**Why this matters for publication:** this is both a substantive and editorial communication issue; referees explicitly asked that caveats be moved to high-visibility sections (intro/conclusion framing).

## Priority revisions required before publication

### 1) Re-scope contribution statement and title-claim alignment (high priority)

- Reframe from “wealth” language to “medium-run regional output dynamics after major earthquakes,” unless independent wealth/productivity evidence is added.
- In abstract + introduction + conclusion, use explicit language: “output overshoot does not imply welfare gain or net wealth increase.”

### 2) Upgrade mechanism section from narrative to empirically anchored (high priority)

At minimum, add a clearly-labeled “mechanism evidence is suggestive” subsection with direct reduced-form tests:
- reconstruction intensity proxies,
- insurance payout timing/intensity alignment,
- sectoral non-construction productivity or value-added behavior,
- demand-composition or investment proxies where available.

If full identification is infeasible, state limitations sharply and demote causal mechanism claims.

### 3) Close reviewer-response gaps with complete, point-by-point text (high priority)

- Replace all blank “Response.” placeholders.
- Explicitly map each unresolved comment to manuscript location (section/page/figure/table) and explain residual limitations.

### 4) Strengthen comparability calibration (medium priority)

- Add a compact table that reports harmonized event and regional baseline metrics with interpretive bounds.
- Tone down institutional “causal” wording unless additional evidence is provided.

### 5) Increase transparency on remaining data limitations (medium priority)

- For outcomes unavailable in Chile over full windows (population/total GDP decomposition limits), give a concise data-availability appendix table and discuss implications for interpretability symmetry.

## Publication-shape diagnosis

- **Empirical execution:** strong and improving.
- **Identification of headline mechanism:** still weak for top empirical standards.
- **Narrative discipline (estimand vs claim):** needs tightening.
- **Resubmission readiness:** not yet; requires one more focused revision cycle.

**Bottom line:**
With revisions above, the paper is **plausibly publishable in *Empirical Economics***. In its current state, it is best characterized as a **promising revise-and-resubmit candidate, not an acceptance-ready manuscript**.
